Description:
This is an ascii rogulike RPG I built in my free time.
It could easily be expanded by creating more levels and differnt power ups,
but for now it is a working prototype which has a beginning, middle, and an end!

Check out the Release folder if you want to play the game! (if you are using windows 7 you'll have to run wmic command to resize console window to full screen)

See screen shots if you don't actually want to play the game.
